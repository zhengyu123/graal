# Certificate Management in Native Image

Native-image provides multiple ways to specify the certificate file used to
define the default trusted KeyStore. In the following sections we describe the
available buildtime and runtime options. Note the default behavior for
native-image is to capture and use the default trusted KeyStore from the
buildtime host environment.

## Buildtime Options

During the image building process, native-image captures the host environment's
default trusted KeyStore and embeds it into the native image. This KeyStore is
by default created from the root certificate file provided within the JDK, but
can be changed to use a different certificate file by setting the buildtime
system property "javax.net.ssl.trustStore" (see [Properties](Properties.md) for
how to do so).

Since the contents of the buildtime certificate file is embedded into the image
executable, the file itself does not need to present in the target environment.

## Runtime Options

The certificate file can also be changed dynamically at runtime via setting
the "javax.net.ssl.trustStore\*" system properties.

If any of the following system properties are set during image execution,
native-image also requires "javax.net.ssl.trustStore" to be set and for it
to point to an accessible certificate file:
- javax.net.ssl.trustStore
- javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType
- javax.net.ssl.trustStoreProvider
- javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword

If any of these properties are set and "javax.net.ssl.trustStore" does not point
to an accessible file, then an UnsupportedFeatureError will be thrown.

Note that this behavior is different than the JVM; while in the event of an
unset/invalid "javax.net.ssl.trustStore" system property the JVM will attempt to
fallback to use a certificate file shipped within the JDK, such files will not
be present alongside the image executable and hence cannot be used as a
fallback.

During the execution, it also possible to dynamically change the
"javax.net.ssl.trustStore\*" properties and for the default trusted KeyStore to be
updated accordingly.

Finally, whenever all of the "javax.net.ssl.trustStore\*" system properities
listed above are unset, the default trusted KeyStore will be the one captured
during buildtime, as described in the [prior section](#buildtime-options).
